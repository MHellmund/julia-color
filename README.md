# Julia Color Extension for Quarto

This extension 

- provides support for Jupyter code output cells with ANSI escape sequences and
- uses the [JuliaMono font](https://juliamono.netlify.app/) as monospaced font. 

It works both for 

- HTML and 
- LaTeX/PDF output. 

The web fonts for HTML are provided by the extension. For LaTeX/PDF you
[have to install the ttf files](https://juliamono.netlify.app/download/).



*The extension works only with a patched version of quarto!*


## Installation


```bash
quarto add MHellmund/julia-color
```
